You are a senior full-stack engineer + product-minded architect.

Build an MVP web app called “Audit Collective OS” to facilitate a vetted group of smart contract auditors collaborating on audits, peer review, and reputation tracking.

GOAL
Ship a working MVP that supports:
1) Auditor onboarding + vetting status
2) Audit intake + assignment
3) Findings creation + severity + review workflow
4) Peer review + escalation
5) Reputation points + basic metrics dashboard

TECH STACK (choose these unless blocked)
- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript
- Prisma ORM + SQLite (local) for speed
- NextAuth (email magic link OR simple username/password for MVP)
- TailwindCSS for UI
- Zod for validation

CORE ENTITIES (DB models)
- User: id, name, email, role (admin/auditor/client), tier (observer/contributor/reviewer/lead/core), status (applied/probation/active/removed)
- AuditorProfile: userId, bio, wallet(optional), proofLinks (array), skillsTags (array), notes
- VettingApplication: id, userId, submittedAt, links (array), writeupText, score (0-100), decision (pending/accepted/rejected), reviewerUserId, comments
- Audit: id, title, clientName, scopeText, repoUrl, chain, status (intake/in_progress/review/finalized), createdAt
- AuditAssignment: id, auditId, userId, assignmentType (lead/reviewer), createdAt
- Finding: id, auditId, title, description, severity (info/low/medium/high/critical), category, reproSteps, impact, recommendation, status (draft/needs_review/approved/rejected), createdByUserId, createdAt
- FindingReview: id, findingId, reviewerUserId, decision (approve/reject/request_changes), notes, createdAt
- ReputationEvent: id, userId, type (finding_accepted/finding_rejected/review_completed/false_positive_caught/escalation_resolved), points (+/- int), auditId(optional), findingId(optional), createdAt

SCORING / REPUTATION RULES (implement simply)
- finding_accepted: +5
- finding_rejected: -3
- review_completed: +2
- false_positive_caught: +4
- escalation_resolved: +3
Maintain a computed “reputationScore” for each user (sum of ReputationEvent points).

FEATURES / PAGES (must have)
Public (no login needed):
- Landing page describing the system briefly.

Auth required:
- /dashboard: shows your role, tier, reputationScore, and quick links
- /audits: list audits, create audit (admin + client only), view audit detail
- /audits/[id]: audit detail page with assignments and findings
- /audits/[id]/assign: admin can assign lead + reviewer from active auditors
- /audits/[id]/findings/new: auditor can create finding
- /findings/[id]: view finding + reviews; reviewers can submit a review
- /vetting: application form (for new auditors) + admin review queue
- /admin/users: admin can change tier/status and view metrics
- /metrics: leaderboard of auditors by reputationScore, plus counts of accepted/rejected findings

WORKFLOW RULES (enforce)
- Only users with status=active can be assigned to audits.
- Only tier=reviewer or above can submit reviews.
- A Finding becomes “approved” only after 1 review is approve. (MVP)
- If reviewer rejects, set finding status=rejected and log a ReputationEvent for creator.
- When review is submitted, log ReputationEvent for reviewer (review_completed).
- When finding approved, log ReputationEvent for creator (finding_accepted).

UI REQUIREMENTS
- Clean, simple UI with Tailwind.
- Use server actions or route handlers for mutations.
- Show toasts on success/error.
- Use minimal components; do not over-engineer.

SEED DATA
Include a Prisma seed:
- 1 admin user
- 3 auditors with different tiers/status
- 1 sample audit with 2 assignments
- 2 sample findings (one approved, one pending)

DELIVERABLES
1) Working app with run instructions: install, migrate, seed, dev server.
2) Prisma schema + migrations.
3) Minimal auth + role-based access.
4) All pages above functioning end-to-end.
5) README with how to use the workflow.

CONSTRAINTS
- Keep it MVP-simple.
- Do not add payments, notifications, or complex RBAC.
- Favor working code over perfect architecture.
- Everything must run locally inside Replit.

After building, output:
- Folder structure overview
- Key files (Prisma schema, seed, auth config, main pages)
- Commands to run
